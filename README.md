# Server command

This tool was created to be used with the structure used by [mage-db-sync](https://github.com/jellesiderius/mage-db-sync)
as seen [here](https://github.com/jellesiderius/mage-db-sync/wiki/Configuring-settings-and-databases#configuring-databases).
It currently only uses the `username`, `server`, and `port` values.
